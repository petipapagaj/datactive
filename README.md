# What is DATActive?
Datactive keep the static data synchronized in the database
Return with status code which show whether or not the data is identical to the data in repository
Able to show the primary key records which corresponding data is different
Provide help in release process to make sure static data has been released as it is in repository
Generating data version which is a snapshot of the actual state of the database
Able to show if there is any missing table objects in database

# Why the DATActive?
Datactive is able to help when several identical databases have across the system with static data.  

# Usage
EXEC Datactive.HashMatch [ [@version = ] { value }, [@showObjects =]  { 1 | 0 }]
 
Parameter description:
@version: specific version for previously created data versions. Latest version will be picked up from table dbo.DataVersion if no specific version attached as parameter
@showObjects: By default Datactive only return the status code of the execution. Making @showobjects parameter true will force to return the object names where discrepancy found

# Example
 
DECLARE @ret INT
EXEC @ret = Datactive.HashMatch @version = '10.2', @showObjects = 1
SELECT @ret
 
# Data Version
Before every release new data version have to be generated by calling the following procedure
 
EXEC Datactive.CreateDataVersion @version = {@version}
 
Generated data version will be traveling with the release so it can be use as benchmark in comparison.
 
Data versions historically stored in table:
 
SELECT * FROM Datactive.DataVersion AS dv 
# Data format
 
<tables>
  <table table="table1">
    <PK>201</PK>
    <md5>0xEQH1hF4JNHhORIY4/+QA==</md5>
  </table>
 <table table="table2">
    <PK>2307475880</PK>
    <md5>EZ/iJSIk8k3j9TZrBoNnng==</md5>
  </table>
  <table table="table2">
    <PK>2307475881</PK>
    <md5>+FOnsGE9C8Gz8EInymFE8A==</md5>
  </table>
  â€¦
</tables>

# Integration
Simply calling the execute procedure script from Usage section in deploy tool that will turning back the status of the data version validation.
In [deploy tool] SSIS package after every data update on databases setup, common, Setup_gamma, common_gamma the status and differed objects will be written to the log file.
